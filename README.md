# Fashion-MNIST-Dataset-Model-Training
This outlines the training of a neural network for classifying the Fashion MNIST dataset. It explains the choice of Feedforward Neural Network and discusses the model's performance, highlighting possible future improvements.

In this project, i aim to demonstrate the training of a neural network that efficiently classifies and predicts data from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset, developed by Zalando, features 70,000 grayscale images of fashion products across 10 distinct categories and serves as a substitute for the original MNIST dataset for machine learning benchmarking. Methods and processes such as data preprocessing, building of the Feedforward Neural Network using Keras library's Sequential Class, and evaluation of the model's performance are carefully described in the project.

The Feedforward Neural Network, due to its simplistic design and effectivity in tactfully handling multi-class classification problems, is chosen for the task. This network enables learning from the spatial pixel assembly in an image and classifies it into one of ten clothing categories within the Fashion MNIST dataset. Hoiver, as the project proceeds, potential limitations of this model, in terms of overfitting and requirement for future optimization, are also discussed, paving the way for possible future improvements.

In essence, this project encapsulates the methodology behind training a neural network to classify fashion items using the Fashion MNIST dataset with Python programming, folloid by a critical analysis of the results to indicate the efficacy of the network and suggest future directions.

all you have to do is to download this code and run it in the relevent environment.
